In this the player rolls the dice and adds up the face values.If the sum is 7 or 11 in the first throw 
then the player wins.if the first roll sum is 2,3,12 then the player looses. And if the first roll sum is any other
number that the sum becomes the player's point.In the rand() function is used to create 2 random numbers for the variables
dice1 and dice2 b/w 1&6. To win the player must continue rolling the dice untill he/she "makes point".The player looses by rolling
a 7 before the point.Switch statement is used here.Then a while loop starts execuitng if continue=gamestatus.In the loop 2 values
are generated using rand() function. Then sum is calculated. The sum and mypoint are compared.If the condition becomes true game
status will be won.Else the statement check whether sum is 7, if true game status will be lost.While loop executed till here.Then 
using another if statement if(won=gamestatus) is compared if this is true print Playerwon else print Playerlooses.
